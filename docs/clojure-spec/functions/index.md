# Specification for function definitions

 Define specifications for your custom functions

* Additional documentation - argument and return values and the relationship between them.
* Instrumenting functions - checking for correct argument values
* Generative testing - using argument specifications to generate comprehensive test data.

Many of the functions in `clojure.core` have [specifications](https://github.com/clojure/core.specs.alpha) in the latest version of Clojure.  The specifications for clojure.core functions can be found in the [clojure/core.specs.alpha](https://github.com/clojure/core.specs.alpha) repository on GitHub.

## Examples of specifications from core.specs.alpha
Specifications used for the `defn`, `defn-`, `fn` functions in `clojure.core`

```clojure
(s/def ::param-list
  (s/and
    vector?
    (s/cat :params (s/* ::binding-form)
           :var-params (s/? (s/cat :ampersand #{'&} :var-form ::binding-form)))))

(s/def ::params+body
  (s/cat :params ::param-list
         :body (s/alt :prepost+body (s/cat :prepost map?
                                           :body (s/+ any?))
                      :body (s/* any?))))

(s/def ::defn-args
  (s/cat :fn-name simple-symbol?
         :docstring (s/? string?)
         :meta (s/? map?)
         :fn-tail (s/alt :arity-1 ::params+body
                         :arity-n (s/cat :bodies (s/+ (s/spec ::params+body))
                                         :attr-map (s/? map?)))))
```
