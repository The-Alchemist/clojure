# Editor Install Guides

Short guides to using [clojure aware editors](/clojure/clojure-editors) to quickly start with the basics.

References are included to the full documentation for using each editor for further study.


=== "Atom.io" %}

[Atom.io](https://atom.io/) is flexible and simple to use editor.  The [ProtoREPL](https://atom.io/packages/proto-repl) plugin adds support for Clojure and ClojureScript.

### Simplified menu and configuration approach

Proton offers a simple mnemonic menu as an alternative to the somewhat cumbersome keybindings in Atom.io.  Proton also gives you a simple text configuration to manage all your packages quickly.
