# Practicalli Clojure

Getting started with Clojure programming language using [Clojure CLI](/clojure/clojure-cli/) and [community tools](/clojure/clojure-cli/community-tools.md).

A practical guide to learning Clojure with step by step explanations of code and design decisions and live coding videos to demonstrate the Clojure REPL workflow.

!!! QUOTE - "John Stevenson, Practical.li"
    Clojure - an elegant language for a more civilised development experience


## Clojure REPL Driven Development

[![Clojure repl driven development using Clojure aware editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/practicalli/graphic-design/live/clojure/clojure-repl-driven-development-lifecycle-concept.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/practicalli/graphic-design/live/clojure/clojure-repl-driven-development-lifecycle-concept.png)

Clojure runs in [a REPL process](/clojure/clojure-cli/repl/) that provides instant feedback as code is written, encouraging experimentation and allowing effective designs to evolve rapidly and with confidence that comes with a clear understanding.

The REPL is [Clojure interactive environment](introduction/repl-workflow.md) used to create an run Clojure code, in both development and production.  Quickly grow confidence with Clojure by evaluating, breaking, fixing and extending code in the REPL.  All the while getting instant feedback on what the code is doing.


!!! QUOTE "Adrian Cockcroft - formally Cloud Architect, Netflix"
    The most productive programmers I know are writing everything in Clojure and swearing by it and then just producing ridiculously sophisticated things in a very short time. And that programmer productivity matters.


## About the book

Practicalli Clojure provides a hands on approach to learning Clojure through the entire development workflow.

As we work through code we will discuss the concepts behind Clojure, including functional programming, "pure" functions and a stateless approach with persistent data structures, changing state safely, Java interoperability and tooling around Clojure.
