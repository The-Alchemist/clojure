# Hotload libraries in Clojure Projects

![Hotload libraries into a Clojure Editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/practicalli/graphic-design/live/clojure/clojure-repl-hotload-libraries-editors.png)

Run a Clojure REPL configured with the [:lib/hotload alias to include the library dependencies](hotload-libraries.md).

Use a rich comment block or [a `dev/user.clj` file](/clojure-cli/projects/configure-repl-startup.md) to require the `clojure.tools.deps.alpha.repl` namespace and write `add-libs` expressions to hot-load libraries.

## Hotload Alias

=== "Practicalli Clojure CLI Config"
    `:lib/hotload` alias defined in [practicalli/clojure-deps-edn](https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-deps-edn/) adds the latest SHA commit from the `add-libs3` branch of `clojure.tools.deps.alpha` library as an extra dependency.

    Include the `:lib/hotload` alias when starting the REPL, using any of the available Clojure CLI execution options (`-A`,`-M`,`-X`,`-T`).

    See [Terminal REPL](hotload-libraries-terminal-ui.md) and [Clojure Editor](hotload-libraries-editor.md) pages for examples.

=== "Manual"
    Edit the project `deps.edn` configuration and add an `:lib/hotload` alias for the `clojure.tools.deps.alpha.repl` library.  Or add an alias to the user level configuration for use with any Clojure CLI project.

    The `add-libs` code is on a separate [add-libs3 branch](https://github.com/clojure/tools.deps.alpha/tree/add-lib3), so requires the SHA from the head of add-libs3 branch

    ```clojure
      :lib/hotload
      {:extra-deps {org.clojure/tools.deps.alpha
                   {:git/url "https://github.com/clojure/tools.deps.alpha"
                    :git/sha "e4fb92eef724fa39e29b39cc2b1a850567d490dd"}}}
    ```

    > Alias example from [practicalli/clojure-deps-edn](https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-deps-edn/)


## Rich Comment Block

A rich comment block ensures `add-libs` code is only evaluated manually by a developer.

```clojure
(comment
  (require '[clojure.tools.deps.alpha.repl :refer [add-libs]])
  (add-libs '{http-kit/http-kit {:mvn/version "2.5.1"}})
)
```


## Clojure LSP snippets

[Snippets provided by Clojure LSP](https://clojure-lsp.io/features/#snippets) include `rich-comment-hotload`, to add a rich comment block with a require for `clojure.tools.deps.alpha` and an `add-libs` expression, making it very quick to add this code.

`deps-maven` and `deps-git` snippets help ensure the correct syntax is used for the `add-libs` expression for each library dependency to be added.


## Hotload Example

Create a web server from scratch, serving pages generated from hiccup, with all libraries hot-loaded as the code is being written.  Demonstrates that it is possible to write an application when only starting the REPL once.

```clojure
(comment
  ;; run REPL with :lib/hotload alias
  (require '[clojure.tools.deps.alpha.repl :refer [add-libs]])

  ;; hotload the libraries required for the server
  (add-libs
    '{http-kit/http-kit {:mvn/version "2.5.1"}})
  ;; => (http-kit/http-kit)


  ;; Require the namespace from the http-kit library
  (require '[org.httpkit.server :as app-server])

   ;; Define a handler for http requests
  (defn welcome-page
    [request]
    {:status  200
     :body    "Welcome to the world of Clojure CLI hotloading"
     :headers {}})

  ;; Start the application server with the handler
  (app-server/run-server #'welcome-page {:port (or (System/getenv "PORT") 8888)})

  ;; Visit http://localhost:8888/ to see the welcome-page

  ;; Hotload Hiccup to generate html for the welcome page
  (add-libs '{hiccup/hiccup {:mvn/version "2.0.0-alpha2"}})

  (require '[hiccup.core :as hiccup])
  (require '[hiccup.page :as hiccup-page])

  ;; Create a page template
  (defn page-template [content]
    (hiccup-page/html5
      {:lang "en"}
      [:head (hiccup-page/include-css "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bulma@0.9.0/css/bulma.min.css")]
      [:body
       [:section {:class "hero is-info"}
        [:div {:class "hero-body"}
         [:div {:class "container"}
          [:h1 {:class "title"} (:title content) ]
          [:p {:class "subtitle"} (:sub-title content)]]]]]))

  ;; Check the page template returns HTML
  (page-template {:title     "Hotload Libraries in the REPL"
                  :sub-title "REPL driven development enables experimentation with designs"})


  ;; redefine the welcome page to call the page template
  (defn welcome-page
    [request]
    {:status  200
     :body    (page-template {:title     "Hotload Libraries in the REPL"
                              :sub-title "REPL driven development enables experimentation with designs"})
     :headers {}})

  ;; Visit http://localhost:8888/ and refresh the page to see the new welcome-page
  )
```


# Using add-libs with project deps.edn

A project `deps.edn` file can also be used to hotload libraries with `add-lib`.  This has the advantage that newly added libraries become part of the normal project dependency configuration.

Add a namespace definition to the `deps.edn` file to help editors understand the `deps.edn` file is being used for code.  Use the `#_` comment reader macro with the namespace definition to only evaluate this code manually as a developer.

Add the `add-libs` expression after the `:deps` key so that it is easy to slurp in the existing and new dependencies as a single hash-map.  Use the comment reader macro `#_` to only evaluate this code manually.

To hotload, remove the `#_` temporarily and slurp in the hash-map of dependencies, placing a `'` at the start of the hash-map.  Add the name and version of libraries to hotload in the hash-map.  Evaluate the `add-libs` expression which should return a list of new namespaces added.

Once hotload has finished, barf the hash-maps of dependencies from the `add-libs` expression, removing the `'`.  Add the `#_` to the `add-libs` expression and save the file.

The hotloaded libraries are now available by requiring their namespaces.  If the REPL is restarted, the new dependencies will be included in the Classpath as they are now part of the project configuration.

 :aliases {}
```
