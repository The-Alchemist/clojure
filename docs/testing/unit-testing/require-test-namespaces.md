## Requiring Namespaces
A test namespace has a singular purpose to test a matching application namespace.  Therefore the idiomatic approach is to `:refer` specific functions from `clojure.test` as those functions are used.

The namespace to be tested is referred using the alias `SUT` meaning system under test.

The alias highlight the exact functions being tested in the body of the code.  This provides a visual way to separate functions under test with other test functions, especially if there are helper functions or vars used for test data.

In the above example it is easy to see which namespaces the functions being tested are from.  The `dictionary` namespace is a source of data for those tests.


{% tabs repl="In the REPL", project="In a Clojure Project" %}

{% content "repl" %}
```clojure
(require '[clojure.test :refer [are deftest is testing]])
```

The namespace under test should be referred, typically using the alias SUT for software under test.

```clojure
(require '[practicalli.playground :as SUT])
```


{% content "project" %}

Add `clojure.test` to the namespace definition along with the namespace under test.

```clojure
(ns practicalli.app-namespace-test
  (:require '[clojure.test :refer [are deftest is testing]]
             [practicalli.app-namespace :as SUT]))
```

{% endtabs %}

> #### Hint::SUT alias - system under test
> The alias `SUT`, meaning system under test, is [a common convention in software testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_under_test).  Using the SUT alias makes it easier for developers to see which functions from the application are being tested at a glance.
