# With Vectors of Vectors

The most frequent use of  you will see is in the `project.clj` file, where a vector of vectors is used to model the library dependencies for a project

```clojure
[[org.clojure/clojure "1.8.0"]
 [org.clojure/core.match "0.3.0-alpha4"]]
 
[[org.clojure/clojure "1.6.0"]
 [ring "1.4.0-beta2"]
 [compojure "1.3.4"]
 [hiccup "1.0.5"]]
```

> **Fixme** Think of an exercise to create a vector of vectors as a data model
